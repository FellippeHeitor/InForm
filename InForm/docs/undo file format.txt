-----------------------------------------------------------
Below is the binary format for undo/redo data saved to file
'InForm/UiEditorUndo.dat'. Each time a new control is created or
a new property is changed, the preview saves the current state to
this file and adjusts 'total undo images' and sets 'undo pointer'
accordingly.

This format is used in UiEditorPreview's methods:
    - SaveUndoImage
    - RestoreUndoImage
    - RestoreRedoImage
