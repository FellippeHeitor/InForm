"Here is the Sun at the Centre of the Solar System"
" We are Zoomed into Mercury ... "
" ... And Venus "
" Now Let's Zoom Out "
"  Now We See The Earth... "
" and The Moon "
" The Earth and Moon Circle Each Other Closely "
" And This Is Mars "
" The Size of the Objects On Screen "
"  Is Not Dependent Upon Actual Body Size, But  "
"  Depends Upon How Far Away They Are  "
" Now Speed Up The Display By Increasing The Step Time "
"It Looks As If Venus Moves Close to the Path of The Earth"
" But If We Change Orientation "
" We Can See The Orbits Quite Clearly "
" Now Let's Zoom Out Again and Change Orientation "
" Here's Jupiter "
" Display Can Be Switched From Tracks ... "
" To Spots "
" And Back to Tracks "
" Change from Energy to Bodies "
" Now The Earth Launches a Satellite "
" We Need to Temporarily Decrease Step Time "
" To Successfully Launch the Satellite "
" Clear The Display "
" Jupiter Swings The Satellite Out of Its Normal Orbit "
" Saturn "
" Thank You for Enduring This Demonstration "
